== NAME

esh - simple template system based on shell


== SYNOPSIS

*esh* [-d] [-o _output_] [-s _shell_] [--] _file_ [_variable_ _..._]

*esh* \<-h | -V>


== DESCRIPTION

*esh* (embedded shell) is a templating engine for evaluating shell commands embedded in arbitrary templates.
It's like ERB (Embedded RuBy) for shell, intended to be used for templating configuration files.
Unlike ERB it provides support for including one ESH template into another (since version 0.2.0).

*esh* converts template _file_, or _stdin_ if _file_ is "`-`", into a sequence of shell commands.
Commands between _<%_ and _%>_ tags are passed as-is, everything else is escaped and prefixed with *printf* command.
These commands are eventually evaluated using _shell_ (unless *-d* is specified).


== OPTIONS

*-d*::
  Don't evaluate template, just dump a shell script.

*-o* _file_::
  Output file or "`-`" for STDOUT.
  Defaults to "`-`".

*-s* _shell_::
  Command name or path of the shell to use for template evaluation.
  It must not contain spaces.
  Defaults to "`/bin/sh`".

*-h*::
  Show help message and exit.

*-V*::
  Print version and exit.


== ENVIRONMENT

*esh* may be configured using the following environment variables:

*ESH_AWK*::
  Command name of path of the awk program to use.
  It must not contain spaces.
  Defaults to "`awk`".

*ESH_MAX_DEPTH*::
  Maximum include depth.
  Defaults to 3.

*ESH_SHELL*::
  The same as *-s* _shell_.

The following extra environment variables are available inside the template and for the processes spawned by *esh*:

*ESH*::
  Path of the *esh* interpreter.


== EXIT STATUS

*esh* exits with the exit status of _shell_ or awk unless some error has encountered before converting the template.

* *0*  - Clean exit, no error has encountered.
* *1*  - Generic error.
* *10* - Invalid usage.
* *11* - ESH syntax error.
* *12* - Include error: file not found.
* *13* - Include error: exceeded max include depth (*ESH_MAX_DEPTH*).


== TEMPLATE SYNTAX

ESH has two tags for shell code, a tag for include, comments, and a way to escape tag delimiters.

<% commands %>::
  Executes the _commands_ and replaces this tag with its output on _stdout_.

<%= values %>::
  Executes _printf '%s '_ with the _values_ as arguments and replaces this tag with the output (without trailing white space).
  _values_ are not quoted or escaped, so all shell substitutions are applied.

<%+ filename %>::
Reads and converts ESH template from the _filename_ and puts it in place of this tag.
Includes are processed recursively, but the depth is limited by *ESH_MAX_DEPTH*.
+
If the _filename_ is relative, it's resolved against the directory of the template file in which this tag resides.
If the template is read from _stdin_, the first level includes are resolved against the current working directory.
Please note that includes are processed during the conversion, not the evaluation phase, so the _filename_ cannot be an expression or a variable!
+
Unlike the others, this tag must be closed on the same line, otherwise it's a syntax error.

<%+1 filename %>::
Same as _<%+_ with _once_ semantics i.e. it will simply skip the entire tag if the _filename_ has already been referenced before.

<%# comment %>::
  Removed from the final output.

-%>::
  May be used instead of _%>_.
  It trims the following line break if used at the end of line, otherwise has no trimming effect.

<%%::
  A literal _<%_ when used outside of the above tags.

%%>::
  A literal _%>_ when used inside of the above tags.

Opening and closing tag may not be at the same line.

Text outside a tag becomes literal text, but it is subject to any tagged shell code surrounding it.
For example, text surrounded by a tagged *if* statement only appears in the output if the condition is true.


== EXAMPLES

[source, nginx]
.nginx.conf.esh
----
http {
    access_log <%= $logs_dir/access.log %> main;

    resolver <%= $(sed -En 's/^nameserver ([^#]+)/\1/p' /etc/resolv.conf) %>;

    <% if nginx -V 2>&1 | grep -q lua-nginx-module; then -%>
    lua_package_path '<%= $(pkg-config --variable=INSTALL_LMOD lua) %>/?.lua';
    <% fi -%>

    <%+ ./http-common.esh %>

    <%# The rest of the config is omitted %>
}
----

To generate the resulting configuration file run:

[source, sh]
esh -o nginx.conf nginx.conf.esh logs_dir=/var/log/nginx
